## 🎯 Getting Started - First Time Using the Dashboard

### What You Need to Do (Takes 5 Minutes)

**Step 1: Open the Dashboard**
- Find "Cloud Native Assessment" in your ConfigMgr Console ribbon
- Or double-click the desktop shortcut

**Step 2: Connect to Your Intune Data**
1. Click the green **"🔗 Graph"** button at the top
2. A popup shows a code (like "ABC-DEF-123")
3. Copy that code
4. Open your web browser → go to https://microsoft.com/devicelogin
5. Paste the code and click Next
6. Sign in with your Microsoft 365 admin account
7. Click "Accept" when it asks for permissions
8. Come back to the dashboard - it'll say "Connected" with a green checkmark

**Step 3: Connect to Your ConfigMgr Data (Optional but Recommended)**
1. Click the blue **"🖥️ ConfigMgr"** button at the top
2. If it finds your ConfigMgr automatically: Great! You're done
3. If it asks for your site server: Type it in (like "CM01" or "CM01.contoso.com")
4. It connects automatically using your Windows login

**Step 4: Let It Load**
- Takes 30-60 seconds to load all your data
- You'll see numbers start appearing in the sections
- Green checkmarks at the top = everything's working

**Step 5: Look Around**
- Click through the 3 tabs at the top (Overview, Enrollment, Cloud Readiness)
- Get familiar with where things are
- Don't worry - you can't break anything by clicking around
- Additional tabs (Workloads, Applications, AI Actions) can be enabled via command-line switches

### What If Something Doesn't Work?

**"Permission Error" or "Authorization_RequestDenied":**
This means your account doesn't have the required Intune permissions.

**REQUIRED ROLE (one of these):**
- **Intune Administrator** ✅ (Recommended - full Intune access)
- **Global Reader** (Read-only access to all Microsoft 365 services)
- **Global Administrator** (Full access to everything)

**REQUIRED API PERMISSIONS:**
- `DeviceManagementManagedDevices.Read.All` - Read Intune device data
- `DeviceManagementConfiguration.Read.All` - Read Intune configurations
- `DeviceManagementApps.Read.All` - Read app deployment data
- `Directory.Read.All` - Read user/directory information

**HOW TO FIX:**
1. Ask your **Global Administrator** to assign you the **Intune Administrator** role:
   - Go to Entra ID (Azure AD) → Users → [Your Account]
   - Click "Assigned roles" → "Add assignments"
   - Select "Intune Administrator" → Assign
2. Sign out and sign back in to the dashboard
3. The permissions will take effect immediately

**Alternative - Admin Consent (for entire organization):**
A Global Administrator can pre-consent to these permissions for all users:
```
https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant-id}/adminconsent?client_id=14d82eec-204b-4c2f-b7e8-296a70dab67e
```
Replace `{tenant-id}` with your actual tenant ID.

**"Connection failed" error (other reasons):**
- Click **🔍 Diagnostics** button (orange) to see what's wrong
- Network connectivity issues
- Azure AD authentication problems

**"No data showing" error:**
- Click **🔄 Refresh** button (blue) to reload
- Check if the Graph and ConfigMgr buttons show green checkmarks
- Click **📋 Logs** button (gray) to see detailed error messages

**"Can't find the dashboard in ConfigMgr Console":**
- The installation might not have worked
- Try running `Install-ZeroTrustMigrationAddin.ps1` again
- Or ask whoever installed it to check

## 🖥️ ConfigMgr Admin Service Setup

### Why Connect to ConfigMgr?

**Without ConfigMgr (Graph API only):**
- ❌ Only see devices already enrolled in Intune
- ❌ Can't determine true migration gap
- ❌ Missing co-management workload status
- ❌ Incomplete device inventory

**With ConfigMgr + Graph API:**
- ✅ Complete Windows 10/11 device inventory
- ✅ True migration gap (total - enrolled = remaining)
- ✅ Real co-management workload data
- ✅ Accurate progress metrics
- ✅ Better AI recommendations with full context

### Setup Instructions

#### Step 1: Enable ConfigMgr Admin Service

The Admin Service must be enabled on your ConfigMgr site server.

**Check if it's already enabled:**
1. Open **ConfigMgr Console**
2. Go to **Administration > Site Configuration > Sites**
3. Right-click your site → **Hierarchy Settings**
4. Look for "Administration Service" tab

**If not enabled:**
Follow Microsoft's guide: https://learn.microsoft.com/mem/configmgr/develop/adminservice/overview

#### Step 2: Verify Your Permissions

You need **one of these roles** in ConfigMgr:
- ✅ Full Administrator
- ✅ Read-only Analyst

**To check:**
1. ConfigMgr Console → **Administration > Security > Administrative Users**
2. Find your user account
3. Verify role assignment

#### Step 3: Find Your Admin Service URL

The URL format is:
```
https://[YourSiteServer]/AdminService
```

**Examples:**
- `https://CM01.contoso.com/AdminService`
- `https://sccm.corp.contoso.com/AdminService`
- `https://cm01.contoso.local/AdminService`

**To find it:**
1. Your site server name is in **Administration > Site Configuration > Sites**
2. The Admin Service uses HTTPS on the default site server

#### Step 4: Test the Connection (Optional)

Open PowerShell and run:

```powershell
$url = "https://CM01.contoso.com/AdminService/wmi/SMS_Site"
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $url -UseDefaultCredentials
```

If you see site information, the Admin Service is working!

### Connection Status

**Click the 🔍 Diagnostics button** to see:

**ConfigMgr Connection Status Shows:**
- **"Admin Service (REST API)"** - ✅ Using preferred method (HTTPS REST API)
  - Fastest and most efficient
  - Modern authentication
  - Recommended method

- **"WMI Fallback (ConfigMgr SDK)"** - ⚠️ Using fallback method
  - Admin Service failed or unavailable
  - Automatically fell back to WMI queries
  - Still functional but slightly slower

- **"None"** - ❌ Not connected to ConfigMgr
  - Device counts incomplete (Intune-only)
  - Need to fix connection issues

**Why Admin Service Might Fail:**
1. Admin Service not enabled on site server
2. HTTPS certificate issues
3. Firewall blocking port 443
4. Insufficient permissions
5. Site server not detected properly

## 🎯 Understanding What You See

### Device Counts (The Numbers)

**Total Windows 10/11 Devices** = All your Windows 10/11 computers  
**Intune-Enrolled** = Computers already moved to cloud management  
**ConfigMgr-Only** = Computers still waiting to migrate  

**What counts?** Only Windows 10 version 1607+ and Windows 11. Servers, older Windows, Macs, phones don't count (they're managed differently).

### The Autonomous Enrollment Agent (The Robot)

This is your AI assistant that can automatically enroll devices:

**How it works:**
1. Tell it your goal (e.g., "Enroll 100 devices by next Friday")
2. It creates a plan with specific batches and timing
3. You review and approve the plan (one button click)
4. It executes automatically - you just monitor progress
5. Hit the STOP button if you need to pause

**Safety features:**
- Only enrolls "ready" devices (scored 60+ out of 100)
- Small batches (25-50 devices at a time)
- Pauses if too many failures
- You approve every plan before it runs
- Emergency stop button always available

### Device Readiness Scores (The Grades)

Each device gets a score from 0-100 based on how ready it is to enroll:

- **80-100 (Excellent)** ✅ - Perfect! Enroll these now
- **60-79 (Good)** 👍 - Ready to go, minor things to watch
- **40-59 (Fair)** ⚠️ - Needs some prep work first
- **0-39 (Poor)** ❌ - Not ready, fix issues first

**What makes a device "ready"?**
- Has Windows 10/11 (not Windows 7)
- Joined to Azure AD (cloud identity)
- Online recently (last 7 days)
- Compliant with policies

### Workload Status (The Colored Dots)

Each workload shows a status color:

- 🟢 **Green = Done** - This workload is fully migrated to Intune
- 🟡 **Yellow = In Progress** - Migration started but not finished
- 🔴 **Red = Not Started** - Still using ConfigMgr for this workload
- 🔵 **Blue = Pilot** - Testing with a few devices first

**The 7 workloads you'll migrate:**
1. Compliance Policies (security requirements)
2. Device Configuration (settings and profiles)
3. Windows Updates (patch management)
4. Endpoint Protection (antivirus, firewall)
5. Resource Access (VPN, WiFi, email)
6. Office Click-to-Run (Microsoft 365 apps)
7. Client Apps (application deployment)

### Alert Colors (The Warnings)

Alerts show different colors based on urgency:

- 🔴 **Red = Critical** - Deal with this today (devices offline, compliance dropped, migration stalled)
- 🟡 **Yellow = Warning** - Address this week (non-compliant devices, running low on licenses)
- 🔵 **Blue = Info** - Good news or FYI (new enrollments, milestones reached)

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

### For Your First Week

**Day 1:** Connect to Graph and ConfigMgr, let data load, just look around  
**Day 2:** Check Overview tab daily - get familiar with your numbers  
**Day 3:** Try the Autonomous Agent with 10 test devices  
**Day 4:** Review Cloud Readiness tab - understand your blockers  
**Day 5:** Share Overview metrics with your manager

### Speed Up Your Migration

1. **Use the Agent** - It's way faster than manual enrollment
2. **Start with high-readiness devices** - 80+ scores are slam dunks
3. **Do workloads in order** - Compliance → Configuration → Updates → Protection → Resource Access → Office → Apps
4. **Batch wisely** - 25-50 devices at a time is the sweet spot
5. **Check alerts daily** - Small problems become big problems fast

### If Things Go Wrong

- **Click 📋 Logs** - See exactly what happened
- **Click 🔍 Diagnostics** - Check if you're still connected to everything
- **Hit 🛑 STOP** - If the Agent is enrolling devices and something's wrong
- **Click 🔄 Refresh** - Sometimes data just needs to update
- **Check alerts** - They often tell you exactly what's wrong

## ❓ Quick Questions Answered

**Q: Do I need Azure OpenAI for AI recommendations?**  
A: Yes - AI-Powered Recommendations require Azure OpenAI (GPT-4) to be configured. Without it, the dashboard will show setup instructions. All other features (device enrollment data, workload status, compliance, alerts) work without Azure OpenAI. The AI recommendations are a premium feature that provides context-aware guidance.

**Q: What data is sent to Azure OpenAI? Is it private?**  
A: Only aggregated migration metrics (device counts, percentages, workload names, days since progress). NO device names, user names, IP addresses, or any personally identifiable information (PII) is sent. Data goes to YOUR Azure OpenAI instance only. Microsoft doesn't use your data to train models. All API calls are logged locally for audit.

**Q: Will the Agent break my environment?**  
A: No - it has multiple safety checks. It only enrolls "ready" devices, does small batches, requires your approval, pauses on failures, and you can stop it anytime.

**Q: How do I know if my data is real or fake?**  
A: After you connect to Graph and ConfigMgr, all data is real from YOUR environment - device counts, compliance, workload status, alerts, and the Enrollment Impact Simulator results. The status bar shows your current data source (Graph, ConfigMgr, or Demo mode).

**Q: What if I don't have ConfigMgr Admin Service?**  
A: The tool automatically falls back to Graph API only. You'll see devices already enrolled in Intune, but won't see the complete count of devices still on ConfigMgr. Still useful, just less complete.

**Q: How often should I check this?**  
A: Daily for Overview tab (5 minutes). Weekly for Cloud Readiness tab (15 minutes). Workloads and Apps tabs (if enabled) as needed when planning migrations.

**Q: Can I break something by clicking buttons?**  
A: Buttons either open documentation (safe), show information (safe), export lists (safe), or let you approve agent plans (requires your approval first). No "delete all devices" buttons here.

**Q: Where can I get help?**  
A: Click the **📖 Guide** button in the top toolbar - opens full documentation. Click **📋 Logs** to see what's happening under the hood. Click **🔍 Diagnostics** to check connections.

## 📦 Automated Installation (Recommended)

### One-Command Install

```powershell
.\Install-ZeroTrustMigrationAddin.ps1
```

The automated installer handles everything:
- ✓ Checks for administrator privileges (elevates if needed)
- ✓ Detects ConfigMgr Console installation
- ✓ Downloads and installs .NET 8.0 Runtime if missing
- ✓ Builds application with all dependencies
- ✓ Deploys to ConfigMgr Console
- ✓ Validates installation
- ✓ Creates uninstaller

**Expected Time:** 2-5 minutes

### Installation Verification

After installation:
1. Launch ConfigMgr Console
2. Look for "Cloud Native Assessment" in ribbon/toolbar
3. Click to open dashboard

---

## 🔧 Manual Installation

If automated installation fails, use manual steps:

### Step 1: Build the Project

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\dannygu\Downloads\GitHub Copilot\cmaddin"
dotnet build -c Release
```

### Step 2: Deploy to ConfigMgr Console

Copy XML manifest:
```powershell
$extensionsPath = "${env:ProgramFiles(x86)}\Microsoft Configuration Manager\AdminConsole\XmlStorage\Extensions\Actions"
Copy-Item "ZeroTrustMigrationAddin.xml" -Destination $extensionsPath
```

Copy executable and dependencies:
```powershell
$binPath = "${env:ProgramFiles(x86)}\Microsoft Configuration Manager\AdminConsole\bin"
Copy-Item "bin\Release\net8.0-windows\*" -Destination $binPath -Recurse -Force
```

### Step 3: Restart ConfigMgr Console

Close and reopen the ConfigMgr Console.

---

## 💾 Offline Installation

For machines without internet access:

### Step 1: Download Prerequisites (on connected machine)

```powershell
# Download .NET Runtime installer
$url = "https://download.visualstudio.microsoft.com/download/pr/6224f00f-08da-4e7f-85b1-00d42c2bb3d3/b775de636b91e023574a0bbc291f705a/windowsdesktop-runtime-8.0.11-win-x64.exe"
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $url -OutFile "windowsdesktop-runtime-8.0.11-win-x64.exe"
```

### Step 2: On offline machine

1. Copy application folder and .NET Runtime installer
2. Install .NET Runtime manually:
   ```powershell
   .\windowsdesktop-runtime-8.0.11-win-x64.exe /install /quiet
   ```
3. Run installer:
   ```powershell
   .\Install-ZeroTrustMigrationAddin.ps1 -SkipBuild
   ```

---

## 🗑️ Uninstallation

After installation, an uninstaller is automatically created:

```powershell
.\Uninstall-ZeroTrustMigrationAddin.ps1
```

The uninstaller removes:
- All application files from ConfigMgr Console
- XML manifest
- Desktop and Start Menu shortcuts
- Does NOT remove .NET Runtime (other apps may use it)

---

## � Custom App Registration

By default, Cloud Native Assessment uses Microsoft's public "Microsoft Graph Command Line Tools" app (`14d82eec-204b-4c2f-b7e8-296a70dab67e`). If your organization requires a custom app registration, follow these steps:

### When to Use Custom App Registration

- Your security team won't approve Microsoft's public app
- You need to restrict access to a specific tenant
- Corporate policy requires custom app registrations
- You're blocked by conditional access policies

### Step 1: Create App Registration in Azure Portal

1. Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) → **Entra ID** → **App registrations**
2. Click **New registration**
3. Name: `Cloud Native Assessment` (or your preferred name)
4. Supported account types: **Single tenant** (recommended) or **Multitenant**
5. Click **Register** (skip Redirect URI for now)

### Step 1b: Configure Redirect URI (Important!)

> ⚠️ **This step is critical** - selecting the wrong platform type will cause authentication to fail.

1. In your new app, go to **Authentication**
2. Click **Add a platform**
3. **Select "Mobile and desktop applications"** (NOT "Web")
4. Check the box for `http://localhost`
5. Click **Configure**

![Platform Selection](docs/images/entra-platform-selection.png)

> ✅ **Correct**: Mobile and desktop applications  
> ❌ **Wrong**: Web applications

### Step 2: Configure API Permissions

Go to **API permissions** → **Add a permission** → **Microsoft Graph** → **Delegated permissions**

Add these permissions:

| Permission | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `DeviceManagementManagedDevices.Read.All` | Read Intune devices and compliance |
| `DeviceManagementConfiguration.Read.All` | Read compliance policies, device configs |
| `DeviceManagementApps.Read.All` | Read mobile apps, MAM policies |
| `DeviceManagementServiceConfig.Read.All` | Read Autopilot, enrollment config |
| `Directory.Read.All` | Read Azure AD devices |
| `Group.Read.All` | Resolve group names in assignments |
| `Organization.Read.All` | Read tenant info |
| `User.Read` | Sign in and read user profile |

After adding, click **Grant admin consent for [Your Tenant]**.

### Step 3: Configure Cloud Native Assessment

1. Click the **🔐 Auth** button in the toolbar
2. Check **Use custom app registration**
3. Enter your **Application (Client) ID** (from Azure Portal)
4. Optionally enter **Tenant ID** (leave blank for auto-detect)
5. Click **Save Settings**

### Alternative: Environment Variables

You can also set environment variables to override the default app:

```powershell
$env:GRAPH_CLIENT_ID = "your-client-id-guid"
$env:GRAPH_TENANT_ID = "your-tenant-id-or-domain"
```

### Authentication Methods

Cloud Native Assessment supports two authentication methods:

| Method | Description | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Interactive Browser** (Default) | Opens default browser for sign-in | Corporate environments with proxies, conditional access |
| **Device Code Flow** | Enter code at microsoft.com/devicelogin | When browser auth doesn't work, headless scenarios |

Change the method via the **🔐 Auth** button in the toolbar.

##  Data Sources Reference

### Real Data (From Your Tenant)

#### 1. Device Enrollment (Dual-Source)

**Primary Source:** ConfigMgr Admin Service
```http
GET https://[SiteServer]/AdminService/wmi/SMS_R_System
?$filter=contains(OperatingSystemNameandVersion,'Windows NT Workstation 10')
```

**Secondary Source:** Microsoft Graph API
```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/deviceManagement/managedDevices
```

**Properties Accessed:**
- `managementAgent` - MDM, ConfigMgr, Co-managed
- `enrolledDateTime` - Enrollment date
- `deviceName`, `operatingSystem` - Device info
- `azureADDeviceId` - Cloud identity

**Device Counting:**
```
Total Win10/11 = ConfigMgr (all workstations)
Intune-Enrolled = Graph (MDM + co-managed)
ConfigMgr-Only = Total - Enrolled
```

#### 2. Compliance Scorecard

**Source:** Microsoft Graph API
```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/deviceManagement/deviceCompliancePolicies
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/deviceManagement/managedDevices?$select=complianceState
```

**Properties:**
- `complianceState` - Compliant, NonCompliant, InGracePeriod
- `deviceCompliancePolicies.displayName` - Policy names

**Calculation:**
```
ComplianceRate = (CompliantDevices / TotalDevices) * 100
```

#### 3. Workload Status

**Source:** Microsoft Graph API + ConfigMgr

**Detection Logic:**
- **Compliance:** Query `DeviceManagement.DeviceCompliancePolicies`
- **Device Configuration:** Query `DeviceManagement.DeviceConfigurations`
- **Client Apps:** Query `DeviceAppManagement.ManagedAppPolicies`
- **Co-Management Sliders:** Query ConfigMgr workload authority

**If policies found:** Workload marked "Completed"

#### 4. Alerts & Recommendations

**Source:** Analyzed from tenant data

**Real Alerts:**
- Devices not synced 7+ days (actual device list)
- Recent enrollments (last 7 days, actual count)
- Non-compliant devices (actual affected devices)
- Policy deployment status
- ConfigMgr-only devices needing enrollment

### Data Access Permissions

**Microsoft Graph API:**
- `DeviceManagementManagedDevices.Read.All`
- `DeviceManagementConfiguration.Read.All`
- `DeviceManagementApps.Read.All`
- `Directory.Read.All` (user verification)

**ConfigMgr:**
- Full Administrator role
- Or Read-only Analyst role
- Admin Service enabled (CB 1810+)
